 <h2> USER EXPERIENCE RESEARCH </h2>
 <p> TRANSMIT is a task scanner and archiver that features a barcode system that allows workers to digitally update their status of their current work. It is used to enhance Flynn Contracting’s work environment by increasing productivity through delivering live updates, logged information, and utilizing a unique system that suits both digital and non-digital means to fit within their existing environment.

For this project, my team and I worked closely with Flynn Contracting for 3 months. We utilized interviews, ethnography, cultural probes, and participatory workshops to critically address the Manufacturing Department head, Romeo Tarrayo, and discover how we can improve his current work environment through better communication within his scope. </p>

<h2> the problem </h2>

<p>Flynn Manufacturing often encounters delays in completing projects because of inaccurate exchange of information due to lack of confirmation, poor record keeping, and a non-cohesive communication system. </p>

<h2> why transmit works</h2>

<p>TRANSMIT builds on pre-existing practices within the company. With Transmit, Flynn's Manufacturing Department is keeps the traditional paper task sheets that they are used to, and the new additions to their work flow such as the live feed are designed to be easily integrated into the worker's everyday lives.

Interaction is feasible and familiar to current demographics. The simple, efficient to use interface is designed with the needs of busy manufacturing workers in mind.

Overall, TRANSMIT fulfills the company's goals of real-time updates and information. </p>


<h2> what i learned</h2>

<p>This project is the first experience I had in regards to working with a potential client in a real-world context and their constraints. Through this project, I learned the importance of effective user research, as well as different qualitative research methods to fully  assess the needs of Flynn Manufacturing. Because my group and I were able to understand Flynn's culture and workflow, we were able to come up with a solution that could really improve their everyday lives.
