    <h1>Project 1 : Transmit</h1>

    <h3>Project Video</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1XONzv6K5g">Transmit's Project Video</a>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Flynn Manufacturing often encounters delays in completing projects because of inaccurate exchange of information due to lack of confirmation, poor record keeping, and a non-cohesive communication system. </p>

   <h3>The Solution</h3>
   <p>Using the insights we gathered from three months of research, we come up with TRANSMIT.

TRANSMIT is an application featuring a barcode system that inputs projects when scanned, and sends project updates onto screens stationed at key points in the manufacturing department.</p>

<h3>How Transmit Works <h3>
  <img src="images/transmit1.png">


<h3> The Process</h3>

    <img src="images/transmit2.png" class="image1">
    <p>I was involved with designing the search process as well as the feed screens. When we spoke with Romeo about our concepts, he said that the most important update is when projects are on hold, as this can cause delays for shipping. I used colour coding to indicate project status - red for on hold, green for completed, and blue for started. On hold projects are highlighted in read for maximum visibility.</p>

<h3> Why Transmit Works </h3>
<p>TRANSMIT builds on pre-existing practices within the company. With Transmit, Flynn's Manufacturing Department is keeps the traditional paper task sheets that they are used to, and the new additions to their work flow such as the live feed are designed to be easily integrated into the worker's everyday lives.

<br><br>Interaction is feasible and familiar to current demographics. The simple, efficient to use interface is designed with the needs of busy manufacturing workers in mind.

<br><br>Overall, TRANSMIT fulfills the company's goals of real-time updates and information.

<h1>Project 2 : Lighthouse</h1>

<h3>Project Website</h3>
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~johannac/Lighthouse/src/">Lighthouse Website</a>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>We started ideating with the goal of assisting youths with free resources where  they can grow emotionally or educationally. Currently, there are no apps that offer resources exclusive to the LGBTQA+ community. We wanted to cater to them specifically, and help them seek refuge in their times of need. </p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Lighthouse is a LGBTQA+ exclusive safe house finder for youths organized and sponsored by local Vancouver youth services. It is designed to be a quick and efficient solution for LGBTQA+ youth 19 and under to find a safe, temporary environment to stay in if they are experiencing trouble at home, school, or anywhere else.</p>


<h3> The Process</h3>

<img src="images/lighthouse1.png" >
<p>Our biggest inspiration while designing our wireframes was Airbnb, but we also drew patterns from Tinder and Google. I was responsible for creating some mockups of the user interface, including on boarding. As on boarding is the first impressions the user will have while interacting with our application, I designed this interface to be as simple and easy to navigate as possible, with clear text and visible icons.</p>

<h3> What I learned </h3>
<p>While this project pushed my research, wire framing, and interface design skills, the most valuable thing I learned was the new perspective I gained in regards to design and how it can be applied. By working with the LGBTQA+ and finding out about their needs and concerns, I really learned how to use empathy in my design decisions and design on a human level. I learned how to put myself in someone else's shoes and design for the user and practice instead of myself.
