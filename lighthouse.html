 <h2> USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN </h2>
 <p> Lighthouse is a LGBTQA+ exclusive safe house finder for youths organized and sponsored by local Vancouver youth services. It is designed to be a quick and efficient solution for LGBTQA+ youth 19 and under to find a safe, temporary environment to stay in if they are experiencing trouble at home, school, or anywhere else.

Lighthouse was created by a team comprising of myself and 3 other students. Click the link below to view the final product, or keep scrolling to find out how we did it! </p>

<h2> the problem </h2>

<p>We started ideating with the goal of assisting youths with free resources where  they can grow emotionally or educationally. Currently, there are no apps that offer resources exclusive to the LGBTQA+ community. We wanted to cater to them specifically, and help them seek refuge in their times of need.</p>

<h2> what i learned</h2>

<p>While this project pushed my research, wire framing, and interface design skills, the most valuable thing I learned was the new perspective I gained in regards to design and how it can be applied. By working with the LGBTQA+ and finding out about their needs and concerns, I really learned how to use empathy in my design decisions and design on a human level. I learned how to put myself in someone else's shoes and design for the user and practice instead of myself. </p>
